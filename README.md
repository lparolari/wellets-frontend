# ESPEC ReactJS Template

## Introduction

Q. What do you mean with ESPEC?

A. It is an acrostic to a set of tools that assist in the design patterns: **ES**Lint, **P**rettier and **E**ditor **C**onfig.

This template uses this set and has some rules set up to streamline when you start a new project.

## ESLint

ESLint is used to automate code patterns, such as mandatory semicolons at the end of the line. It is good when you work with other developers, as ESLint makes everyone follow the same patterns.

## Prettier

Prettier is also used to automate code patterns, so its use with ESLint guarantees many options for correcting the code in the best possible way for all developers working on the project.

## Editor Config

Lastly, editor config is used to define the same rules for everyone working on the project, even when using different code editors or IDEs.

## Conclusion

Q. It is really very good! So where can I find more information about these tools to change this template int the way that is best for me?

A. If you can read in Pportuguese, this link will be very useful for you and this template was developed from it: [Design Patterns by Rocketseat on Notion](https://www.notion.so/Padr-es-de-projeto-com-ESLint-Prettier-e-EditorConfig-0b57b47a24724c859c0cf226aa0cc3a7). Otherwise, if you can not read in Portuguese, you can check the official documentation for these tools: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) and [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org/).
